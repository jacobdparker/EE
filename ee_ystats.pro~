;PROGRAM: ee_ystats
;PURPOSE:
; 1. Compute spatial distribution of each boxed event from eemouse
; 2. Compute average physical width for all events
; 3. Compute average physical width of event for each observation and plot
; 4. Plot each event against its date such that the size of the dot
; corresponds to the physical width of the event
; 5. Save plots to a directory of width plots
;PARAMETERS:
;  dat_array=4x100x31 array containing dimension data for event boxes
;  dates=array of Julian dates of each observation
;  count=array of number of boxes on each image
;VARIABLES:
;  depth=number of observations
;  lengths=2D array of lengths of each event in each observation
;  avg_lens=array of average width of an event during each
;  observation
;  dev_lens=array of standard deviations of widths of each event
;  during each observation
;RETURNS: N/A
;SAVES: Plots are saved into a directory containing width plots (TBA)
